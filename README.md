Insight 1
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yasser.muhammad/viz/YoutubeCategoryDashboard/CategoryDashboard?publish=yes

From this dashboard we can tell that in the trending section music has received the most views
and likes
Followed by entertainment that has received the second most views and likes
However more people disliked entertainment and music
The filter in the dashboard shows that videos published way before the trending date can also
make it to the trending page


Insight 2
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yasser.muhammad/viz/EngagementRatioMap/EngagementRatioMap?publish=yes

I’ve calculated the engagement ratio to be (comments +likes + dislikes)/views
The higher the ratio the better the engagement with the videos
This is a map that shows which states produced the most engaging videos that appeared in the
trending tap
California seems to be in the lead followed by texas
The filters offer a view of what’s the engagement like when it is limited either by disabling
comments or ratings



Insight 3
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yasser.muhammad/viz/TopTrendingTags_16519171420140/TopTagsViewsTrending?publish=yes

This is a chart of the trending tags in timespan between November 2017 and March 2018
I’ve limited the tags to only the top viewed overall tags
We can see that pop was the top trending tag in november 2017
And for march 2018 it was trailer
Hovering over any line shows not only the views but also the amount of likes and dislikes a tag
has received in the month
